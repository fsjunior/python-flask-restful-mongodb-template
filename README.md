A simple and powerful üêç+flask RESTful template with MongoDB.

**Warning**: this project is not finished yet and some important features may still be
missing. Please see the [Roadmap](#roadmap) for more details.

## What this template have

- Bleeding edge [Python 3.9](https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html) (although 
this template probably will work with older Python versions as well);
- [Flask](flask.palletsprojects.com) micro-framework;
- RESTful API with pagination and Swagger/ReDoc OpenAPI specification using the incredible [flask-smorest](https://flask-smorest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/);
- Schemas with [marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/);
- ODM with [mongoengine](http://mongoengine.org/);
- Testing and coverage reports with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)
and [pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov);
- Coverage report upload and badging with [codecov](https://codecov.io/);
- Static typing enforcement with [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy);
- Linting with [flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8),
[black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/);
- Security analysis with [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit);
- Dependencies and environment management [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/);
- Continuous Integration with [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Roadmap

- [x] CI working;
- [x] 100% testing code coverage;
- [x] Simple restful API;
- [x] OpenAPI/Swagger/ReDoc documentation.
- [x] Make project use environment variables and .env files;
- [x] Pagination;
- [x] Migrations/seeding;
- [x] Simple requests caching support
- [x] Customized error messages;
- [ ] CD example to a PaaS.

## Getting started

After cloning this repository for your project, init the `poetry` environment and install 
the project dependencies:

```console
~ $ poetry install
```

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided with a pre-configurated MongoDB service that can
be used for **testing and development**. To run the tests, you will need to start it:

```console
~ $ docker-compose up -d
```

You will also need a `.env` file for local development and testing. You can copy the
`dotenv.test` file for this purpose.

```console
~ $ cp dotenv.test .env
```

Now you can run the tests

```console
~ $ make coverage
```

Or you can run the template in development mode

```console
~ $ make run-dev
```

Go to your browser to access the Swagger or ReDoc auto-generated docs:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/doc/swagger
http://127.0.0.1:8080/doc/redoc
```


## The template

#### Rationale

Almost every feature here is provided by the libraries that I'm using
(e.g. pagination is provided by flask-smorest and flask-mongoengine).
So, most of the code here is just glue code and library configurations.

Files and folders structure pattern: I always use specific files for 
specific resources and use a `common` module/file to the that code will 
be used by different resources.

#### Structure

Explore the files and folders structure to understand the code and
what you have to change to adapt the template to your project. 
Here some basic info to help:

There are two parent folders: `app` and `test`. As you may have guessed, `app` contains the
app files and `test` have all the tests and fixtures. The `test` folder structure is
mirrored from `app`, so it is easy to find where the tests are.

Inside the `app` folder, there are three sub-folders:

- `api` which contains API sub-folders `schema` (for schemas), `rest` (for RESTful views), 
`query` (for queries) and `exceptions` (for exceptions definitions).
- `common` with common files like a settings file.
- `model` with the MongoDB collection models.

In the root directory, there are other important files as well:

A `Procfile` with web and release (to apply the migrations) targets.

The `run.py`, the entry point of the service.

A `Makefile` with the CLI commands.

The `setup.cfg` for linting configuration.

## CLI

#### Check all linting and tests

This will check the linting (`isort`, `flake8` and `black`), the static typing (`mypy`)
will do a security analysis (`bandit`) and will analayze the code coverage (`pytest --cov`).

```console
~ $ make check-all
```

You can also run these steps separately with the `check-lint`, `check-typing`, `check-security`
and `coverage` make targets.

To fix the lint, you can run:

```console
~ $ make fix-lint
```

#### Create a migration

```console
~ $ make generate-migrations
```

The generated migration will be placed in the `migrations` folder in the root directory
and it is generated with [pymongo-migrate](https://github.com/stxnext/pymongo-migrate).
The connection string to MongoDB service used is the one present in `.env` file.

## Other configurations

This template is configured to use codecov to analyze the code coverage.
If you would like to do it too, you need to create a [codecov](https://codecov.io/)
account e associate it with your project.

## FAQ

### This template is useless, as you did not used any authentication method for it

Authentication (and authorization) are normally environment dependent. It is
hard to use a library that will be suitable for most of the use cases. Thus, I 
decided to not put any authentication (or authorization) method here. 

### Can I use this template in a production environment?

Probably, but with caution. Always do a quality analysis with tools like
[sonarcloud](sonarcloud.io) before deploying. You should also have in mind that this
template does not provide everything for a production environment. For example, the
`docker-compose.yml` provided is not suitable for a production environment.

### Why don't you create a cookiecutter template?

Besides I like cookiecutter, I believe that this seed/template is so simple and easy
to understand and customize that there is no need to create a cookiecutter template
for it.

### Can I contribute to this project?

Of course! If you would like to see a new feature, please open a new issue.
