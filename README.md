## FAQ

### Can I use this project in a production environment?

I don't know. Should I?

### Why don't you create a cookiecutter template?

Besides I like cookiecutter, I believe that this seed/template is so simple and easy to understand and customize that there is no need to create a cookiecutter template for it. 

### Can I contribute to this project?

Of course! You can contribute suggesting improvements and making PRs. üòâ
